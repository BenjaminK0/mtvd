"The center for industry solutions is working on an Autonomous Object Reconstruction and Additive Manufacturing System: This project uses a Yaskawa Robot Arm, OPC UA, OpenCV, and a 3D printer to scan real-world objects, generate 3D meshes, and print them autonomously. It demonstrates IT/OT convergence by integrating robotics, vision, and manufacturing with OPC UA. The system follows a scan-trigger-print workflow, outputs reusable automation scripts, and completes in 8 weeks. Future ideas include AI object classification, defect detection, and integration with IBM Maximo or Boston Dynamics Spot for delivery."
"The center for industry solutions is working on an Smart Door Response System Using Ring Alarm, MQTT, Node-RED, and Boston Dynamics Spot: This project uses facial recognition to detect known individuals and command Spot to open the lab door.
